# Explanation of Infrastructure:

**1. What is a server?**

- A server is a powerful computer that stores, processes, and manages network data, resources, and services.

**2. What is the role of the domain name?**

- The domain name is a human-readable address used to identify the server on the internet.

**3. What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?**

- The DNS record "www" in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record.

**4. What is the role of the web server (Nginx)?**

- The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests from users' browsers. It serves static content, processes dynamic requests, and communicates with the application server.

**5. What is the role of the application server?**

- The application server executes the web application code and generates dynamic content based on user requests. It processes business logic, interacts with the database, and returns dynamic responses to the web server.

**6. What is the role of the database (MySQL)?**

- The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website's structured data. It stores information such as user accounts, content, and other vital data.

**7. What is the server using to communicate with the user's computer requesting the website?**

- The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

# Issues with this Infrastructure:

**1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**

- This infrastructure has a single server, which means it has a single point of failure. If the server hardware fails or experiences any issue, the entire website will become inaccessible until the problem is resolved.

**2. Downtime during Maintenance:**

- During maintenance tasks like deploying new code that requires restarting the web server, the website will experience downtime. Users won't be able to access the site until the maintenance is complete.

**3. Limited Scalability:**

- This setup cannot handle a large volume of incoming traffic efficiently. If the website experiences a traffic surge, the single server might not be able to handle the load, leading to slow performance or even crashes.
