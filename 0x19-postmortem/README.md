# Postmortem

### Duration:

- Start Time: January 15, 2024, 02:30 AM (UTC)
- End Time: January 15, 2024, 05:45 AM (UTC)

### Impact:

- Service: Web Application
- User Experience: Users experienced intermittent outages and slowdowns, resulting in a 20% increase in error rates during the incident.

## Timeline:

### Detection Time:

- January 15, 2024, 02:30 AM (UTC)

### Detection Method:

- A monitoring alert flagged an abnormal spike in HTTP 500 errors.

### Actions Taken:

- Investigated backend servers for potential issues, suspecting a database connection problem.
- Initiated a database server restart as an initial mitigation measure.

### Misleading Paths:

- Explored network latency as a potential cause but ruled it out after thorough analysis.
- Checked recent code deployments for anomalies, finding none.

### Escalation:

- Escalated the incident to the DevOps and Database teams for a more in-depth investigation.

### Resolution:

- Identified and addressed a database deadlock issue caused by increased concurrent transactions.
- Temporarily mitigated the problem with a database server restart.
- Implemented an enhanced deadlock detection mechanism for a more permanent solution.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

### Root Cause:

- Database deadlocks occurred due to heightened concurrent transactions.
- Inadequate deadlock detection and resolution mechanisms exacerbated the issue.

### Resolution:

- Developed and implemented an improved deadlock detection algorithm for timely identification.
- Optimized database queries to minimize transaction duration, reducing the likelihood of deadlock occurrences.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

### Improvements/Fixes:

- Strengthen monitoring to proactively detect and alert on deadlock scenarios.
- Implement automated alerts for anomalous database behavior.
- Conduct a comprehensive code review to identify and optimize long-running transactions.

### Tasks:

- Task 1: Update monitoring scripts to include specific deadlock-related metrics.
- Task 2: Establish automated alerts for abnormal database activity.
- Task 3: Conduct a thorough code review for potential transaction optimization.
- Task 4: Schedule a knowledge-sharing session on effective deadlock resolution techniques for the development team.
- Task 5: Document and share the incident's findings with the broader engineering team for awareness.

## Conclusion:

During the early hours of January 15, 2024, our web application experienced intermittent outages, affecting approximately 20% of our users. The root cause was identified as database deadlocks arising from heightened concurrent transactions. Immediate actions were taken to mitigate the issue, and the incident was escalated for a more detailed investigation.

To prevent future occurrences, we've implemented a more robust deadlock detection mechanism, optimized database queries, and introduced proactive monitoring with automated alerts. The incident's learnings will be shared across teams, reinforcing our commitment to continuous improvement and system resilience. This postmortem serves as a transparent account of the incident, detailing the timeline, root cause, resolution, and measures taken to prevent similar issues in the future.
